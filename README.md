# Aadhaar based record keeping system
This software project is developed for maintaining the records of members of an institution based on their Aadhaar numbers. It was part of my intermediate curriculum. The purpose of this software is to develop the management information system to automate the record keeping of Aadhaar data.

This JDBC project, being simple in design and working, doesn't require much training for users and can be used as a powerful tool for handling records.

Java Netbeans IDE 8.2 is used during the coding and design of the software project to obtain a GUI-based integrated platform. As a backend, a powerful open-source RDBMS, MySQL, is used.
